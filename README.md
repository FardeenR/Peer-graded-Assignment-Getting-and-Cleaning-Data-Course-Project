Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo has instructions on how to analyse the Human Activity recognition dataset from below link:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The repo contains the following files:

- CodeBook.md gives a description of the variables used, and how the data was modified and cleaned up.

- run_analysis.R gets the data, cleans it and then perform the following 5 steps:

     1)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

     2)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

     3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

     4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

     5)From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
     
- FinalDataSet.txt is the exported final data after above steps have been performed.
